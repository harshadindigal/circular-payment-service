## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Circular security team takes all security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing the security team at:

**security@circular.com**

The security team will acknowledge your email within 24 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed about the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security vulnerability report, they will:

1. Confirm the vulnerability and determine its impact
2. Audit code to find any similar vulnerabilities
3. Prepare fixes for all affected versions
4. Release fixes as quickly as possible

## Security Update Process

1. Security fixes are applied to the main branch as soon as possible
2. Security fixes are tagged with a security identifier
3. Release notes clearly mention the security issues that were fixed

## Secret Management Guidelines

1. **No Secrets in Code**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or other secrets to the repository
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for all secrets in development and production
3. **Secret Rotation**: All production secrets must be rotated at least quarterly
4. **Access Control**: Secrets must be accessible only to services that require them
5. **Vault**: Use HashiCorp Vault for storing and accessing secrets in production

## Authentication Requirements

### API Authentication

* All API endpoints must use token-based authentication
* Tokens must be short-lived (max 1 hour) with refresh capability

  * At least 12 characters
  * Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
* Multi-factor authentication must be available for all user accounts
* Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
* Password reset links expire after 1 hour
* Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity

## Secure Coding Practices

1. Input validation on all user-supplied data
2. Output encoding to prevent injection attacks
3. Parameterized queries for database access
4. CSRF protection on all forms
5. Content Security Policy implementation
6. Regular security training for all developers

## Compliance Requirements
