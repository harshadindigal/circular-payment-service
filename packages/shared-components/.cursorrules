# Shared Components Rules
- All components must have TypeScript prop types with JSDoc
- Use styled-components for styling (no inline styles, no className strings)
- All form inputs need proper labels and ARIA attributes
- Error states must be user-friendly (no technical jargon)
- Loading states required for all async operations
- Components must be tree-shakeable
- Minimum 80% test coverage required
